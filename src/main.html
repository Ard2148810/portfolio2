            My programming story began in 2013. Since then I have been learning
            plenty of different technologies. Recently I focused more on
            frontend development with CSS/Sass, React, Angular and plain
            JavaScript/TypeScript. Currently I am a freshly graduted student
            with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, with specialization in
            software engineering.
